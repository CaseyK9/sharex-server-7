# PHP Sharex Server
A php sharex server (WIP)

## Installation
Place this repo in a static php-compatible web server and change the config.json api keys array to the api keys you want to use. The next two steps are optional:
- You can edit the upload.php file and change the file upload size, the allowed file extensions, and more. 
- You can also edit the .sharenix.json file for sharenix, or you can use `https://example.com/upload.php?key=1234` with sharex. Obviously you'll need to change the domain and the api key here.
